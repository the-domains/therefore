**INTRODUCTION**

WHAT'S IT
THERE FOR?

One of
the most important moments in my Christian life came when I was a sophomore in
college, a Bible major sitting in a class on the book of Romans (yes, be
jealous; I got to take whole classes that focused on single books of the
Bible!). The funny thing about life-changing moments is that you often don't
realize that you're in one of them at the time; it's only when you look back
that you can see clearly what God was doing. The hand of the Author isn't
always clearly evident when you're in the middle of the story. And so, because
no one tapped me on the shoulder and said, "Take good notes here; what the
professor is about to say will change your life," I don't remember exactly what
we were learning in class that day. I know it was something in Romans,
obviously; perhaps it was a passage we'll look at in this book. Maybe it was
Romans 12:1--- "Therefore, brothers, I appeal to you by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies as a living sacrifice..." Perhaps it was Romans 5:1---
"Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ."

Whatever
passage it was, my professor made an offhand comment, almost in passing, that
changed my life. Before I tell you what it was, stop and consider that
surprising fact---it was a passing comment that changed my life. There's actually
a profound lesson there. When it comes to worldview-reorienting theological
truths---the big bombshells about God that change everything---it's usually not
classes that change people. Seminars and sermons and books don't change people. _Sentences _change people_. __Sentences_

change lives. It's the simple
yet profound thought that jumps out at you in a sermon, that leaps off the page
of a book, which has life-changing potential. And it was one single sentence that
changed my life.

So what
did my professor say? As he was teaching on whatever verse we were studying, he
made this comment:

__

_"Every time you see a 'therefore,'
ask 'What's it there for?' _Are you a
little disappointed? You're probably thinking, "Seriously? That's the sentence
that changed your life? Cough cough _nerd._"
And yes, you're right, I am a huge nerd. That's probably why I write books in
my spare time. But let me explain.

My Bible
professor was pointing out---in a pithy, memorable way---a patently obvious reality
that I had somehow never seen before: the Bible _argues. _The Bible is not a string of disconnected, unrelated verses
about God; much of it---especially in places like Paul's letters---is actually
densely packed theological arguments; logical chains of "If this is true, then
this is the result." And so, when you see a word like, "therefore," it's not a
throwaway word; it's actually the most important word in the verse. It's Paul
saying, "Because of what I just said, therefore this next thing is true." It's
the answer to the most important question you could ever ask of a verse: "Why?"

If you're
still thinking that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill and need to
seriously calm down, let me show you what I mean by looking briefly at Romans
12:1\. We'll look at this more closely in a later chapter; for now, I just want
you to see what I'm talking about and why it's so important.

GOSPEL
BOMB-MAKING

Romans
12:1 stands at a major shift in the letter of Romans. For the first eight
chapters, Paul unpacked the glories of the gospel: sin, faith, justification,
forgiveness, God's promises. Seriously, it's great stuff. Then, in chapters
9-11, he answered a central objection to his gospel: Can God really be trusted
to deliver on his promises? He argues that God has in fact kept all his
promises to Israel and traces God's sovereign purposes through the whole history
of redemption, before arriving at the pinnacle of the entire book, bursting out
in worship at the end of chapter 11:

__

_Oh the depths of the
riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and
how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has
been his counselor? Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid? For
from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever.
Amen! ~Romans 11:33-36_

Those
four verses are a shout of praise to cap off everything Paul has written previously:
the glories of the gospel, the extravagance of free grace, the joy of
justification, the solid foundation of God's promises, the mysteries of his
sovereign purposes, and more. Read the first 11 chapters of Romans and see if
your heart doesn't also want to sing out in worship along with Paul.

You might
see the "Amen" in verse 36 and think Paul is done, but he's not. Not by a long
shot. In fact, something massively important is about to happen. For 11
chapters Paul has been packing gospel explosives into a bomb that he intends to
detonate in our hearts, upending everything, blowing our minds, and changing
our lives. And now, after 11 chapters of glorious gospel bomb-making, he lights
the fuse with the very next word.

What's
that next word? 

Therefore.

"Therefore,"
Paul says---in other words, "In light of everything I just said; because of all
that gospel truth, because God is sovereign and gracious and good and
trustworthy, because he is unsearchably, inscrutably wise and powerful, because
everything that exists is from him and through him and to him..._because of all these things"_---"I appeal
to you, brothers, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and
acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship."

__

_Boom. _The bomb goes off. And the explosion
is what we call "the Christian life." Every act of sacrifice. Every response of
true worship. All your surrender to Jesus, following him, and trusting him.
It's there in verse 12: "Present your bodies as a living sacrifice."

But what
would have happened if you took out the word "therefore" and read that verse in
isolation? You'd see the command to surrender yourself, the command to worship
God rightly... and that would be about it. You might think, as many of us do---as I
used to think---that the Christian life is primarily about _doing._ Sure, you get saved by believing in Jesus and trusting the
gospel. But then the rest of the Christian life is _doing: _surrender to Jesus, follow Jesus, obey Jesus. And the reason
you'd think that is because you missed the most important word in the verse,
the most important word in the Bible: therefore.

That
"therefore" is there to tell you that the Christian life of surrender and
following and obeying Jesus is rooted in and flows from the massive truths of
Romans 1-11\. God's relentless, extravagant love in Jesus, his perfect
righteousness credited to us, his costly sacrifice of his Son, his faithful
keeping of all his promises, his sovereign purposes in history, all culminate
in 12:1\. "Therefore---because of all of that---offer yourself as a living
sacrifice."

Let me
tell you, that changes everything. No longer is the Christian life about duty
or sacrifice. It's not, "Just do it." No, the Christian life is about glory,
it's about grace, it's about the gospel. It's the precious promises, undeserved
mercies, and the mighty God behind them, that form the foundation of the
Christian life. It's the glorious answer to the question "Why?" "Why should I
offer myself as a living sacrifice?" If you can answer that question the way
Paul answers it, you'll have connected the cross to your daily life. And if you
can see it for yourself in the text, if you know what that "therefore" is there
for, your life will never be the same. This changes everything.

STATING
THE OBVIOUS

Let's go
back to me sitting in that Romans class. When my professor said that simple
sentence--- "Every time you see a 'therefore,' ask 'What's it there for?'"---it was
like someone tossed a live grenade into my brain. All my theological
categories, all my ways of reading the Bible, everything I thought I knew about
the Christian life, blew up inside my head. You probably could see smoke coming
out of my ears as my world was rocked from the bottom up. In the years since,
the detonations haven't stopped, as this new way of reading has transformed not
just my theological categories but my entire life, from the bottom up. 

Now, all
of this might be really obvious to you. You might be thinking that I must be pretty
slow to have missed something so simple. But it wasn't obvious to me, not
because it wasn't sitting right there on the page, but simply because no one
had ever pointed it out to me. In all my Bible reading, I had been stringing
pearls instead linking chains; I had only ever been taught to admire the
prettiness and comfort of individual verses, not to see the massive strength
and security that comes from seeing reality linked with reality, knowing _why _these things are true. And I have
the feeling that I'm not the only person who somehow missed that memo.

So, to
put it simply, this is just a book about how to read the Bible, for those like
me who have somehow missed the obvious. This book is about taking a step back
and learning how to follow an argument, to move from premise to conclusion, to
connect the dots and see the whole picture.

LOGIC IS
FOR LOVING JESUS

But
before you put this book down in disgust (because, after all, who wants to read
a book about premises and conclusions? Yuck!) let me make a massively important
clarification. This is a book about logic, true. But it's not _merely _about logic. Logic and premises
and conclusions and participles and arguments are not ends in and of
themselves; they are only a means to an end.

Like
everything else in the universe, logic is for loving Jesus. The goal of this
book is not that you would read better, or even be able to understand the Bible
better. The goal of this book is that Jesus Christ, the worthiest and most
beautiful Person in the universe, would become irresistibly, ravishingly
compelling to your heart. The goal is that his promises would become sweeter to
your soul, that your confidence in his atoning grace would become unshakeable,
and that your life would be lit on fire with an inextinguishable passion to see
his kingdom come and his fame extend to the ends of the earth. 

There is
a kind of knowledge that merely "puffs up" (1 Corinthians 8:1); that's the kind
of knowledge that expands without working to simultaneously expand your love
for the Savior. It's the kind of knowledge that a friend of mine once said "causes
many people to miss heaven by eight inches---the distance from the head to the
heart." As Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13, "If I understand all mysteries and
all knowledge, but have not love, I am nothing." It would be possible for you
to read this book and come away understanding the Bible much better, but not
loving Jesus any more deeply. And that would be tragic. That's not the kind of
knowledge we're after.

But
knowledge---seeing and understanding and embracing truth---is essential for love.
If what 1 John 4 says is true---"We love because he first loved us"---it follows
that the more we understand and appreciate about his love, the more our own
love will grow. The truest purpose of all knowledge is that knowing more would
lead to loving more. Being able to trace the "therefore" in Romans 12:1 isn't
just so that you understand the book of Romans and be more theologically
astute; the purpose is that the kindling of gospel truths in chapters 1-11
would light a fire under the sacrificial offering of your life, passion fueled
by truth. 

To that
end, most of the chapters in this book will follow a similar trajectory. The
first part of the chapter will focus on explaining the significance of a
particular word or logical argument. One chapter will be dedicated to
understanding the importance of the word "therefore;" another will explain
participles; another will unpack the _a
fortiori _argument of the greater to the lesser. But those sections will be
relatively short. The main thrust of each chapter will be to illustrate the
glory and beauty of Jesus by seeing how these logical connections and arguments
work in God's Word. I don't just want you to know the importance of the word
"because." I want you to taste the joy of knowing reasons for your hope, the
security of seeing precious truths argued and defended, and the motivational
impetus of knowing not just what

God
commands, but why . So I want unpack
example after example, in the hopes that you'll start to see these things for
yourself in God's Word, so that long after this book is forgotten you'll still
be reaping all these benefits in your life.

The first
chapter is a little different; before we dive into specific words like
"therefore" and "because," I want to lay a foundation of a different way of
thinking about the Bible and about our relationship with Jesus. We live in a
very anti-intellectual age, and I want to call us back to a part of the
greatest commandment that we might be missing out on: the command to "love the
Lord your God with all your _mind."_ If
we don't seriously consider what that means, we'll not only find ourselves
living in disobedience to that particular command, but to many others as well,
since the New Testament's entire theology of transformation and obedience is
built on a foundation of _knowing_

and _thinking_

_and understanding. _Everything in this book---and, I believe, everything
in the New Testament, flows from that starting point. In order to progress in
the Christian life, we need to take seriously the call to love God with all our
minds. Therefore, that's where we'll start.

_Father, It feels strange to open
up a book about logic with prayer, and perhaps that demonstrates just how
disconnected my head is from my heart. Please use this book, in your mercy, to
strengthen the connections between what I know and what I feel. Do this in my
life and in the lives of all who read this book, so that your people would be
strengthened, your church built up, and your glory advanced in our lives and in
this world. _
